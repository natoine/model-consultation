This project was created during my phd.
I used it in the development of my application for the ANR Intermed Project : 
http://intermed.csregistry.org/tiki-index.php
http://intermed.lirmm.fr/

I wanted to create a model for representation of consultation of resources. 
I use JPA for peristency.
I use it to store when someone consult a resource.
That's absolutely not a long term solution. 
I'm gonna drop it after my phd.
